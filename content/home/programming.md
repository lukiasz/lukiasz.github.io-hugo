Most of commercial things I developed were in C# and I consider myself pretty
experienced with .NET ecosystem. 

Building web applications with rich domain model in both monolith and service-oriented
architecture is what I've been doing mostly in my programming career. Currently, 
I'm looking forward for opportunities to use functional-first languages for
processes and domain modelling purposes.

Here will be a link to Projects page in which you'll be able to see some
of the most interesting projects I've been helping to create. In case you're interested -
here is my curriculum vitae: [link](/cv-olender.pdf).
