I like listening and performing music. I can play pretty well on the clarinet
and have good understanding music theory (scores, acoustic, harmonic and so on).
I'm spending some of my free time playing in local folk band Zespoł Pieśni i Tańca Chorzów as a first
clarinetist. Since June 2016, we're associated with CIOFF organization which is an official
partner of UNESCO. That basically tells that we're representing quite good standards. 
I visited many countries Europe (inside European Union as well as outside of it) with the band.

In the past, I spent some time using computers for electronic music creation.
Synthesizers, samples, what have you. I really like them and although none of
things I created is considered anything more than an experiment, I'll share them on a *Music* subpage soon.
I hope that at some point of my live I'll manage to return to this.
