## About

My name is Łukasz Olender, I'm a 26 years old computer programmer
living near Katowice, Poland. Passionate about every aspect of programming
with strong technical and some enterprenerial skills. Being easy-going and
motivated by achievements person makes me constantly look for new
opportunities — both in programming world and other parts of life.

## Programming

Most of commercial things I developed were in C#.
I consider myself pretty experienced with .NET ecosystem -  tools.

Although for most non computation-intensive things I'm ok with them, I'm
looking forward for opportunities to use functional-first languages for
processes and domain modelling purposes -- I'm one of these guys who believes
in using right tools for right problems rather than adapting problems to
tools that someone already knows. In the world of applications created to
help real businesses operating, the most interesting job is being an
software architect. I'm doing the best I can to be one of them :) 

## Music

I like listening and performing music. I can play pretty well on the clarinet
and have good understanding music theory (scores, acoustic, harmonic and so on).
I'm spending some of my free time playing in local folk band Zespoł Pieśni i Tańca Chorzów as a first
clarinetist. Since June 2016, we're associated with CIOFF organization which is an official
partner of UNESCO. That basically tells that we're representing quite good standards. I visited many countries Europe (inside European Union as well as outside of it) with the band.

In the past, I spent some time using computers for electronic music creation.
Synthesizers, samples, what have you. I really like them and although none of
things I created is considered anything more than an experiment, I'm sharing them on a *Music* subpage.
I hope that at some point of my live I'll manage to 
return to this.

## Other areas

Love skiing, rollerskating, swimming, black holes, coursera, chips and fish,
mass effect, simpsons, the wire, beck, radiohead and beer.
